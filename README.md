Drupal development with Docker
==============================

Quick and easy to use Docker container for your local Drupal development. It contains a LAMP stack and an SSH server, along with an up to date version of Drush. It is based on [Debian Jessie](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianJessie).

Summary
-------

This image contains:

* Apache 2.2
* MySQL 5.6
* PostgreSQL 9.4
* SQLite 3.7
* PHP 5.6
* Drupal 7.x, [Web Experience Toolkit distribution](https://www.drupal.org/project/wetkit) 4.0, development edition (optionally supports current Drupal)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* Drush dev-master version
* Apache Solr 4.10.4
* Adminer latest
* Supervisor
* nano, vim, git and Mercurial (hg)

When launched, the container will contain a ready-to-install Drupal distribution, with no database configured. You need to first create a database by using Adminer off the web root at `/adminer.php`, then select one of PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite as a database, when kicking off a Drupal install.

### Passwords

* MySQL: `root:` (no password)
* PostgreSQL: `postgres:postgres`
* SSH: `root:root`
* Supervisor `supervisor:supervisor`

### Exposed ports

* 80 (Apache)
* 22 (SSH)
* 3306 (MySQL)
* 5432 (PostgreSQL)
* 8983 (Solr)
* 9001 (Supervisor)

Installation
------------

### Github

https://github.com/jmdeleon/docker-drupal

Clone the repository locally and build it:

	git clone https://github.com/jmdeleon/docker-drupal.git
	cd docker-drupal
	docker build -t yourname/drupal .

### Docker repository

https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jmdeleon/docker-drupal-wxt/

Get the image:

	docker pull jmdeleon/docker-drupal-wxt

Running the container
---------------------

The container exposes its `80` port (Apache), its `3306` port (MySQL), its `5432` port (PostgreSQL), its `8983` port (Apache Solr), its `9001` port (Supervisor) and its `22` port (SSH). Make good use of this by forwarding your local ports. You should at least forward to port `80` (using `-p local_port:80`, like `-p 8080:80`). A good idea is to also forward port `22`, so you can use Drush from your local machine using aliases, and directly execute commands inside the container, without attaching to it.

Here's an example just running the container and forwarding `localhost:8080`, `localhost:2222`, `localhost:8984`, `localhost:9291` to the container:

	docker run --rm -t -i --name youralias -p 8080:80 -p 2222:22 -p 8984:8983 -p 9201:9001 yourname/drupal

### MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and Adminer

[Adminer](http://www.adminer.org/) is a tool that can be used to administer MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite databases, contained in a single file of PHP. Adminer is aliased to the web root at `/adminer.php`.

The MySQL port `3306` is exposed. The root account for MySQL is `root` (no password).

The PostgreSQL port `5432` is exposed. The root account for PostgreSQL is `postgres` (password `postgres`).

### Supervisor

[Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) provides a rudimentary web UI over port `9001` to manage several of the server processes (Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, sshd, Solr). It can be found over http `localhost:9201` in the above example, logging in with the id `supervisor` and the password also `supervisor`.

### Apache Solr

Apache Solr 4.x is installed across port `8983`. If port `8983` is mapped as above, Solr is accessible via http `localhost:8984/solr`.
